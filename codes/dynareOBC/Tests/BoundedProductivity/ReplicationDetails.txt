This folder contains the MOD file for the simple model of bounded productivity, for which an exact solution exists.

Timings and simulations for the paper were created by opening MATLAB, then running:

t1=java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis; save time; dynareOBC BoundedProductivity.mod SIMULATION_OPTIONS periodsofuncertainty=1 mlvsimulationmode=1 cubaturetolerance=0 compilesimulationcode; t2=java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis; load time; disp((t2-t1)/1000);

where SIMULATION_OPTIONS are the simulation options of the run in question.
